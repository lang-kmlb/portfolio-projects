# Portfolio Projects
This portfolio is a catch-all for various portfolio projects from online coursework. The projects in here are done with care and attention to detail, but they are not elabore or unique enough to warrant their own repository. Every project has its own aptly named sub-folder. 

## codecademy.com: U.S. Medical Insurance Costs Analysis
A Jupyter Notebook analysing a [Kaggle Dataset about medical cost](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance). A self-guided project as part of the [codecademy.com](https://codecademy.com) course [Data Scientist: Analytics Specialist](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/data-analyst). Various variables are scrutinized in relation to personal medical charges. 

The analysis does not use usual data analytics tools like Pandas. It does, however, use the Python 'statistics' and 'matplotlib' modules.

Challening parts where the non-availability of aforementioned data analytics tools, the inadequate source and proper documentation of the dataset and the use of Matplotlib for creating more involved plots (due to a lack of knowledge about the library).
